# bb-climatology
Climatology (1999-2020) plots for Bedford Basin including; heat flux, freshwater flux, 10m wind, temperature profiles, salinity profiles

These two python scripts generate a climatology for a variety of parameters specific to Bedford Basin.


bedford_basin_ERA5.ipynb uses the ERA5 reanalysis product (available at https://cds.climate.copernicus.eu/cdsapp#!/dataset/reanalysis-era5-single-levels?tab=overview) to generate climatologies for;

heat flux, with a breakdown of components into longwave, shortwave, latent, and sensible heat flux

freshwater flux, with a breakdown of components into precipitation, evaporation, and runoff

10m wind, u and v components


bedford_basin_CTD.ipynb uses CTD cast data from Bedford Institute of Oceanography (available at https://inter-l01.dfo-mpo.gc.ca/sites/bio/science/monitoring-monitorage/bbmp-pobb/bbmp-pobb-en.php?=undefined&wbdisable=true#wb-info) to generate climatologies for;

temperature profiles

salinity profiles
